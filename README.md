Welcome to my repository,  a collection of projects I’ve developed as part of my ongoing Master’s in Data Science at Institute of Business Adminstration(IBA), Karachi.
Each project explores a different area of data-driven problem solving, from  ML to modern deep learning and computational intelligence.

💡 Featured Projects
🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- OCR Tool — converts handwritten notes into digital text.
- Sentiment Analysis — identifies opinions and emotions from feedback datasets.
- RAG-based Question Answering System — combines retrieval and generation for contextual Q&A.

🧠 Fuzzy Logic & Decision Systems
- Fuzzy Logic Model for Diabetes Management — personalized insulin dosing using fuzzy inference.

🖼️ Computer Vision
- Image Classification & Object Detection — CNN and transformer-based models for medical and general vision tasks.

📊 Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

🤖 Supervised Learning Models — predicting outcomes using structured clinical and behavioral data.

🔢 Cluster Analysis — uncovering hidden structures in data using unsupervised learning.

📈 Probabilistic Reasoning

🔍 Bayesian Networks & Causal Inference — modeling uncertainty and reasoning under incomplete information.

🎓 Current Focus

I’m currently working on my Master’s thesis at IBA, focused on medical image segmentation.
